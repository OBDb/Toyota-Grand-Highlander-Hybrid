    description: "The Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid offers electrified powertrain options within the larger Grand Highlander lineup, featuring two distinct hybrid systems to balance efficiency and performance needs. Available in standard hybrid and performance-oriented Hybrid MAX configurations, the Grand Highlander Hybrid maintains the same enlarged proportions as its conventional counterpart, providing enhanced third-row space and cargo capacity over the standard Highlander. The conventional hybrid system combines a 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with electric motors for a combined 243 horsepower, delivering an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in front-wheel drive configuration—impressive efficiency for a vehicle of this size—while offering up to 600 miles of driving range on a single tank. The Hybrid MAX system, available exclusively on the Platinum grade with standard all-wheel drive, pairs a 2.4-liter turbocharged engine with more powerful electric motors to produce 362 total system horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 6.3 seconds at the expense of some efficiency (27 mpg combined). The standard hybrid uses an electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT) system, while the Hybrid MAX features a more conventional 6-speed automatic. Both hybrid variants maintain the same interior appointments, technology features, and cargo capacity as the conventional Grand Highlander, including the 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, available digital instrument cluster, and Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 driver assistance suite. The conventional hybrid configuration particularly emphasizes value, offering class-leading fuel economy without compromising the three-row utility and comfort that define the Grand Highlander's mission. With its combination of spaciousness, efficiency, and available performance, the Grand Highlander Hybrid appeals to families seeking a practical three-row crossover with reduced fuel consumption."
